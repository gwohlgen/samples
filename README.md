# Sample work 

**Here I (Gerhard) start to collect some examples of potentially interesting work related to NLP, data science, etc**

## Files

`analysis_sim.ipynb` and `analysis_sim_bins.ipynb`: **EDA** and **data analysis** for `results.csv`. `results.csv` contains results from intrinsic evaluation of *word2vec word embedding models* trained with different hyperparameters and corpus sizes using common *word similarity datasets* (like SimLex, WordSim, etc.).
After loading with *pandas*, the analysis determines which are the relevant hyperparameters depending on corpus size and dataset, and which are suitable values.

`JRC_all_labels_w_preprocessing.ipynb`: A sample notebook from my research work on large multi-label text classication (LMTC) with legal document (JRC-Acquis). See inside the notebook for more information. In this notebook, we use fastAI techniques on the problem.
