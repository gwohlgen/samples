# Sample work 

**Here I (Gerhard) start to collect some examples of potentially interesting work related to NLP, data science, etc**

## Files

`analysis_sim.ipynb` and `analysis_sim_bins.ipynb`: **EDA** and **data analysis** for `results.csv`. `results.csv` contains results from intrinsic evaluation of *word2vec word embedding models* trained with different hyperparameters and corpus sizes using common *word similarity datasets* (like SimLex, WordSim, etc.).
After loading with *pandas*, the analysis determines which are the relevant hyperparameters depending on corpus size and dataset, and which are suitable values.
